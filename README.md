## Introduction

The purpose of ViewVault is to find and track the anime that you have watched. In addition to this, the app also tracks your screentime, allowing you to keep track of what you watched whilst keeping you conscious of how long you have been watching anime.

Notes for marker: the best view of the website is when there is only room for 4 anime cards in each row

## Usage

To open the website, download the zip and get the file.

Open the terminal in VScode and navigate to the project:

```
cd jeng8615-tracker-deco2017 
```

To download the node modules into the project
``` 
npm install
```

Then type into the terminal:
```
npm run start
```

Copy the link that appears in the terminal in your internet browser (`http://localhost:1234`) to enter the website

## Features

* Login

At the top of the page with the profile pic and the dropdown arrow, this can be clicked to see a "login" modal. The typed name is stored in local storage so when the page is refreshed, it will stay "logged in" with the `inputtedName` still displayed.

* Anime Cards

These cards represent anime shows and upon clicking, a modal will appear with the anime's details and episodes. 

On each anime card modal, there is an `Add to ViewVault` button, by clicking this, it will be added to the "viewvault" section of the page where the user can easily access anime cards when they return to the page.

* Episode checklist

Once a user has watched an episode, they can mark it off as "watched" through checking a check box 

![episode checklist](/img/screenshots/episode-checklist.png)

* Screentime graphs

Once a checkbox is checked, the `episode length` value is added to the screentime graph and updates instantly with every checkbox that is marked off, along with the weekly average. These values represent how much the user is watching.

The screentime graphs on the side are static, and normally would only change with large changes in data. These graphs only emphasise the purpose of the website being a media consumption tracker.

* Search Features 

The search bar and category filters aid in helping users find what anime they would want to find

![search features](/img/screenshots/search-features.png)

* Explore Button

A large button within the "Your ViewVault" section was placed there to compell users to interact with it and take users to the search section where they can add anime to their viewVault

## Comparisons between Mockups and Prototypes

From the hi-fidelity mockups, the project was narrowed down to its main features for the web prototype. 

![hi-fidelity mockups](/img/screenshots/hi-fidelity-mockups.png)

Features that added little to the prototype were removed for example: 

Action bar:

More anime details:

## Refinements and Iterations

Here, the importance of refining and adapting to changes in the prototype from the mockups was demonstrated. 

A major iteration was the narrowing down of the prototype to demonstrate only the main features. The first iteration of the website was a full representation of the app which meant it would carry over the tabs and navigation bar that appear in the mobile display.  

However, it was decided to remove the navigation bar from the desktop display due to the narrowing down of the scope of the prototype as well as an aesthetic decision as the navigation bar felt out of place. This is an image of the previous layout:

![desktop previous layout](/img/screenshots/desktop-previous-layout.png)

An aesthetic choice was to change the look of the checkboxes as previously, they were small and did not match the aesthetic of the website. Code was inspired from W3 schools to change the aesthetic of the checkboxes.

Before:

After:

Final refinements of the code involved the search function and category filters. When using these features, they would search through all the anime cards including the ones that were meant to stay static in the viewvault section. So, by refining the code to only filter through `.anime-search-cards` in the search section of the page, it was fixed.

```
// Display cards with selected filters 
function filterAnimeCards(category) {
    // Filter anime in the search section 
    const cards = document.querySelectorAll(".anime-search-cards.anime-button-div");
    cards.forEach(card => {
        const cardCategory1 = card.getAttribute("data-category1");
        const cardCategory2 = card.getAttribute("data-category2");

        if (category === "all" || cardCategory1 === category || cardCategory2 === category) {
            card.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            card.style.display = "none";
        }
        attachExitButtonListeners();
    });
}
```

The removal of dead buttons that lead to nowhere. These buttons were intended to lead the user to other features of the app, however are no longer needed. For example, a lot of the "see more" buttons were removed

Here, when i console logged "popup", it came up as a nodelist and I learnt that node lists act differently to other elements like a div, therefore style.display = "none" was not going to work. With the help from the above link, stack overflow, i was able to hide the display of the nodelist.

Checkbox style from W3 schools:

Checkboxes were also created with the aid of chatgpt, after establishing a foundational code, the prompt i gave ChatGPT was "how can i make it so that when i check a checkbox it will add it to todayScreentime?" and chatGPT generated the following code:

![chatgpt helping to generate check boxes](/img/screenshots/chatgpt-checkboxes.png)

An issue that occurred was that the display none was not working for popup and overlay. By copy and pasting the section of code that had problems, ChatGPT introduced the function "event.stopPropagation()" which helps to prevent triggering other card click events that are nearly associated to it.
